**What is Recursion?  **
• A concept where a function that calls itself to solve a smaller instance of the same problem  
• Involves breaking down complex problems into simpler subproblems  
• Unlocks advanced algorithms in simple ways

**Recursion Applications**
• Mathematics
• Combinatorics
• Hierarchal structure operations
(such as for file systems)
• Dynamic Programming


**Recursion Examples**
• Factorial
• Fibonacci
• Towers of Hanoi
• Sorting
• Maze solving


***Types of Recursion***
__Naïve Recursion - Top Down__
Uses a top-down approach - start at the original problem
and break it down to smaller subproblems
• Not the most efficient code

__Tail Recursion-Bottom Up__





***Vs. Iteration***
• Iteration
• Any iterative algorithm can be converted
to a recursive algorithm
• Usually more efficient
• Uses less space
• Requires knowledge of loop syntax


• Recursion
• More elegant
• Shorter code
• Easier to understand
